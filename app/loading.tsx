/**
 * Why this file exists, and what its absence did.
 *
 * Every route here is `force-dynamic` — it reads the database on request. Next
 * will not begin a navigation to a dynamic route until either the server has
 * responded or the route offers a fallback. With no fallback, clicking
 * "Dashboard" left the previous page on screen, unchanged, with no spinner and
 * no reaction, for as long as the queries took. It read as a dead button.
 *
 * This is the fallback. It renders instantly, so a click always produces a
 * visible change on the next frame, and the real page swaps in underneath when
 * it is ready.
