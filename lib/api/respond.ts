/**
 * A route that throws before it can answer still has to answer.
 *
 * Next turns an uncaught error in a route handler into a 500 with an EMPTY
 * body and no content type. The caller's `await response.json()` then throws
 * too, and a client that treats that as a failed request reports a network
 * problem — so a misconfigured environment variable on the server surfaced in
 * the browser as "Could not reach the server", which sent the search in exactly
 * the wrong direction.
 *
 * Anything reached before a handler's own try block — parsing the environment,
 * resolving the account, a query against a column a migration has not created
 * yet — is inside this one.
