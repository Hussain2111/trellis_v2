/**
 * A small pool, created lazily and reused across invocations within a warm
 * function. `prepare: false` is required by Supabase's transaction-mode pooler
 * — prepared statements cannot survive a connection being handed to another
 * transaction between statements.
 *
 * `max` is not 1, and that was not a free choice. With a single connection,
 * postgres-js queues every query behind the one in front of it, so a page that
 * fires five independent queries through `Promise.all` still pays five round
 * trips end to end. Against a pooler on the other side of the internet that is
 * the difference between a page that feels instant and one that takes a
 * noticeable second. A handful of connections lets independent work actually be
 * independent; it stays small because Supabase's pooler is a shared resource
 * and this app serves one person.
